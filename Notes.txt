Spark 

- Use clusters which act as one machine
- Distribute the data amoung machines

- Spark Architecture
    Spark has a master–worker architecture, where the master (called the Driver) controls the whole application.
    The Driver sends tasks to many Worker nodes, which actually process the data.
    Each Worker runs Executors, which are mini-processors responsible for running tasks and storing data in memory.
    All nodes communicate through a Cluster Manager (like Spark Standalone, YARN, or Kubernetes), which manages resources.
    Together, this setup lets Spark split big jobs into small tasks and process them in parallel, making everything much faster.
